This is a super-simple sketch that writes serial values from an Arduino sketch to a CSV file. You have to press x at the end of the program to make sure the data get written to file correctly!

NOTE: the Arduino sketch is simply Lady Ada's thermocouple demo, available here: http://github.com/adafruit/MAX6675-library
